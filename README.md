# kottans-frontend
The repository for the "Kottans" front-end course :smiley_cat:

The information below will be my reflections on the studied material according to the given format:
https://github.com/kottans/frontend

### Git Basics:

**Main:**
- [x] [Udemy "Version Control with Git"](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123):
* The "Relative Commit References" vere completely new to me.
* I was surprised Git is not used exclusively by developers.
* I will be using more flags to be able to display information in different ways.

**Extra Materials:**
- [x] [The GitHub Training Team "Communicating using Markdown"](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown)
* I didn't know there was such thing called "Markdown" even though I used some of it's syntax.
* The thing that has surprised me was that you can even create tables with it.
* I am already using it, at least lists and emojis.

- [x] [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com)
* Before I didn't know I type slow and incorrectly :open_mouth:
* I've never mentioned the two little bumps on the "home row".
* I've incorporated every day typing practice in my daily routine.

- [x] [Как учиться и справляться с негативными мыслями](https://guides.hexlet.io/learning/)
* I was familiar with the concept of the "fixed and growth mindsets" but it was nice to refresh it in memory.
* Nothing surprising
* I am using the methodology from the article to track negative thoughts and overcome them.
