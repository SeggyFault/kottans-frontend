The information below will be my reflections on the studied material according to the given format:
https://github.com/kottans/frontend

### Git Basics:

**Main:**
- [x] [Udemy "Version Control with Git"](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123):
* The "Relative Commit References" vere completely new to me.
* I was surprised Git is not used exclusively by developers.
* I will be using more flags to be able to display information in different ways.
- [x] [Learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org) 
  1. Main: Introduction Sequence
  2. Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes
* I saw git branching in graphical representation.
* Git branching is an amazing feature that gives the room for experiments without any harm.
* I will be using it in my future projects.

**Extra Materials:**
- [x] [Git за 30 хвилин](https://codeguida.com/post/453)
* This article helped to recap the basic knowledge in my native language.
- [x] [Git tips](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/git-tips/)
* A good article with the bunch of additional resources which can be used in a future.
- [x] [About Merge Conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts) and [Resoilving a Merge Conflict](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)
* I've learned how to resolve different types of conflicts and installed GitHub Desktop.
- [x] [The GitHub Training Team "Communicating using Markdown"](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown)
* I didn't know there was such thing called "Markdown" even though I used some of it's syntax.
* The thing that has surprised me was that you can even create tables with it.
* I am already using it, at least lists and emojis.
- [x] [Learn anything front-end](https://learn-anything.xyz/web-development/front-end)
* I've taken a look at the resourse and kept it for the future reference.
- [x] [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com)
* Before I didn't know I type slow and incorrectly :open_mouth:
* I've never mentioned the two little bumps on the "home row".
* I've incorporated every day typing practice in my daily routine.
- [x] [Как учиться и справляться с негативными мыслями](https://guides.hexlet.io/learning/)
* I was familiar with the concept of the "fixed and growth mindsets" but it was nice to refresh it in memory.
* I am using the methodology from the article to track negative thoughts and overcome them.
