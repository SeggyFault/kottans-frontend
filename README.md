# kottans-frontend

The repository for the "Kottans" front-end course :smiley_cat:

The information below will be my reflections on the studied material according to the given format:
https://github.com/kottans/frontend

### Git Basics:

**Main:**

- [x] [Udacity "Version Control with Git"](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123):

* The "Relative Commit References" vere completely new to me.
* I was surprised Git is not used exclusively by developers.
* I will be using more flags to be able to display information in different ways.

- [x] [Learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)
  1. Main: Introduction Sequence
  2. Remote: Push & Pull -- Git Remotes

* I saw git branching in graphical representation.
* Git branching is an amazing feature that gives the room for experiments without any harm.
* I will be using it in my future projects.

- [x] Send a pull-request to Kottans/mock-repo proposing a change.

* While doing this task I got authentification problem after trying to do `git --set-upstream origin`. That's how I've found out about personal access tokens :grimacing:

**Extra Materials:**

- [x] [Git за 30 хвилин](https://codeguida.com/post/453)

* This article helped to recap the basic knowledge in my native language.

- [x] [Git tips](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/git-tips/)

* A good article with the bunch of additional resources which can be used in a future.

- [x] [About Merge Conflicts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/about-merge-conflicts) and [Resoilving a Merge Conflict](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)

* I've learned how to resolve different types of conflicts and installed GitHub Desktop.

- [x] [The GitHub Training Team "Communicating using Markdown"](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown)

* I didn't know there was such thing called "Markdown" even though I used some of it's syntax.
* The thing that has surprised me was that you can even create tables with it.
* I am already using it, at least lists and emojis.

- [x] [Learn anything front-end](https://learn-anything.xyz/web-development/front-end)

* I've taken a look at the resourse and kept it for the future reference.

- [x] [TypingClub](https://www.typingclub.com)

* Before I didn't know I type slow and incorrectly :open_mouth:
* I've never mentioned the two little bumps on the "home row".
* I've incorporated every day typing practice in my daily routine.

- [x] [Как учиться и справляться с негативными мыслями](https://guides.hexlet.io/learning/)

* I was familiar with the concept of the "fixed and growth mindsets" but it was nice to refresh it in memory.
* I am using the methodology from the article to track negative thoughts and overcome them.

### Linux CLI, and HTTP:

**Main:**

- [x] [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/)
      ![Linux Survival Module 1](./task_linux_cli/Linux_Survival_M1.png)
      ![Linux Survival Module 2](./task_linux_cli/Linux_Survival_M2.png)
      ![Linux Survival Module 3](./task_linux_cli/Linux_Survival_M3.png)
      ![Linux Survival Module 4](./task_linux_cli/Linux_Survival_M4.png)

* Security chapter was brand new to me. It was very interesting to decypher the terminal output and change permissions to the different types of users.
* The thing that has surprised me was the list of processes I have on my computer which gave me a bit of paranoia :worried:
* I will definitely use everything I've learned apart from the printer related commands (for now) as I don't have any.

- [x] [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)

* I didn't know most of the terms, except of the "status codes".
* It was surprising to find out the "request" and "response" has much more data then I thought.
* For now I don't know how I can incorporate since I don't understand how can I use it.

- [x] [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)

* I've finally understood the difference between "http" and "https".
* The way cache works was more complex.
* It's useful to know what is going "under the hood".

**Extra Materials:**

      ![Основы командной строки Hexlet Finished](./task_linux_cli/Hexlet_Finished.png)

* I have never used Vim before.
* "Streams" and the way of redirecting them was surprising to me (I didn't knew about STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR).
* I got more in-depth understanding of how \*nix systems work and how to interact with them, which I am already applying.

- [x] [How I Taught Myself to Code in Eight Weeks](https://lifehacker.com/how-i-taught-myself-to-code-in-eight-weeks-511615189)

* Before this article I had no idea of the whole structure of the web application.
* It was surprising that you can create a working prototype (including backend) just in 8 weekends.
* I will return back to the resources mentioned in the article and try to do my own prototype (hopefully) in 8 weekends too :neckbeard:

- [x] [How JavaScript works: Deep dive into WebSockets and HTTP/2 with SSE + how to pick the right path](https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-deep-dive-into-websockets-and-http-2-with-sse-how-to-pick-the-right-path-584e6b8e3bf7)

* Now I have an idea what WebSockets are and that there is HTTP/2 that in combination with SSE can be used as its more secure replacement (not in all cases though).

**Optional:**

![Wes Bos "Command Line Power User"](./task_linux_cli/Wes_Power_User.png)

- [x] [Wes Bos "Command Line Power User"](https://commandlinepoweruser.com)

* I already had -zsh but I wasn't aware of it's possibilities, like adding the plugins.
* Suprising was that with the simple instructions I still got errors and spent extra time to google them in order to be able to set up "oh my zsh", "z" and "trash".
* I will definitely use `trash` instead of `rm` to avoid accidental irreversible delitions.

### Git for Team Collaboration

- [x] [Udacity "GitHub & Collaboration"](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud456)
